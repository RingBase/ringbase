vagrant
====

Make sure you have Vagrant[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and Virtualbox[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed.

You'll only need to do this once if you haven't already.
`vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box`

Now run `vagrant up` and you're all set.

To access the Vim run `vagrant ssh`.
